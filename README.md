# Star Tracker RAD
A fully open source Star Tracker / Equatorial mount meant to revolutionize Astrophotography with a "Camera And Lens" style setup. 

# Backstory
I have been forming the ideal budget star tracker in my mind for years now. I think that I have a good enough of a idea now so I created this repo.

# Plan
To make this the ideal tool for creatives and people who like to mess with things. I hate that companies like Sky-Watcher give zero innovation into their models of star trackers and sell them for ridiculous prices with little load capacities. I don't want companies to use this for their own good so take a look into licensing please. I will first develop the StarTrackerR&G before making other more heavyload EQ mounts since it will be my daily driver. It will be a direct competitor to MSM Star Tracker.
