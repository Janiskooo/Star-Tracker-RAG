# OpenStarTracker
A new generation of astronomical mounts made for Any telescope with varying budgets and strenghts.

# Backstory
I have been forming the ideal budget star tracker in my mind for years now. I think that i have a good enough of a idea now aso I created this repositary.

# Plan
To make this the ideal tool for creatives and people who like to mess with things. I hate that companies like Sky-Watcher give zero inovation into their models of star trackers and sell them for ridiculous prices with little carry weight. I don't want companies to use this Take a look into licensing please.
